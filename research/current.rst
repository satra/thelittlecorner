Realtime fMRI and cognitive training to speed recovery from mild traumatic brain injury - mTBI
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PI: John Gabrieli, Robert Van Boven
Funding Source: Department of defense
Collaborators: Posit Science, Banyan biomarkers

The goal is to determine whether cognitive training (in the form of adaptive games) with or without realtime fMRI-based attention-regulation training alleviates cognitive deficits in mTBI patients.

Realtime fMRI and smoking cessation
-----------------------------------

PI: Eden Evins
Funding Source: NIH
Collaborators:  Luke Stoeckel, John Gabrieli, Susan Whitfield-Gabrieli

This project uses realtime fMRI to teach subjects to increase self control by learning to regulate brain activity in regions involved in inhibitory control.

High-resolution structural and functional characterization of mTBI
------------------------------------------------------------------

PI: Raul Radovitsky, John Gabrieli, Nancy Kanwisher
Funding Source:
Collaborators: Bruce Fischl, Larry Wald

Since the neurophysiological deficits in mTBI are poorly understood, the goal of this project is to use the latest MRI technologies and functional paradigms to establish longitudinal differences in brain structure and function in soldiers with and without mTBI.

Neuroinformatics cloud-app and federated data sharing
-----------------------------------------------------

PI: Satrajit Ghosh
Funding Source: INCF
Collaborators: INCF Datasharing taskforce, BIRN, XNAT 

The goal of this project is to ensure that scientists have federated access to data resources in neuroscience and the ability to process these data using cloud-computing infrastructures and that provenance of data is known.

Graph-based multimodal representation and multivariate analysis
---------------------------------------------------------------

PI: Arno Klein
Funding Source: NIH

The goal of this collaboration is to establish features from multimodal MRI data and to collate information in the form of graphs, whose nodes and edges represent different features (e.g., anatomical or functional region, functional connectivity, diffusivity, etc.,.).

Diagnosis and treatment outcome prediction
------------------------------------------

Collaborators: Arno Klein, John Gabrieli, Gael Varoquaux 

The goal of this group of projects is to determine biomarkers for refining diagnosis and for treatment outcome prediction. Current data sets include subjects with social anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, stuttering and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.


Nipype: A platform for efficient and reproducible neuroimaging analysis
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Funding Source: NIH, INCF
Collaborators: NiPy developers

We are part of an opensource effort (NiPy_) to create tools for highly efficient neuroimaging analysis. One component of these tools (NiPyPE_) creates a pipelined environment for integrating different software packages within a unified umbrella. 


Kinematic and neuroimaging studies of stuttering
------------------------------------------------

PI: Joseph S. Perkell
Funded Source: NIH
Collaborators: Shanqing Cai, Frank Guenther, Deryk Beal, Jason Tourville

The aim of this project is to relate behavioral (both acoustic and kinematic) and neuroimaging observations from person who stutter (PWS) and 
 persons with fluent speech (PFS).

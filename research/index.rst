(Re)-Engineering software for neuroimaging analysis
===================================================

PIs: Satrajit S. Ghosh and Susan Whitfield-Gabrieli

Funded by: NIBIB

The aims of this project are to make tools for artifact detection and region of interest analysis available to a worldwide neuroimaging community. We are part of an opensource effort (NiPy_) to create tools for highly efficient neuroimaging analysis. One component of these tools (NiPyPE_) creates a pipelined environment for integrating different software packages within a unified umbrella. The artifact detection tools are already available within this environment and the region of interest tools will be available within the coming months.


Speech Motor Control and Speech Perception
==========================================

PI: Joseph S. Perkell

Funded by: NIDCD

The aims are to characterize and improve mechanistic understanding of speech production and perception. Specifically, we address these aims by acquiring kinematic, acoustic and brain imaging measures related to various speech production and perception tasks. A specific focus of these projects is to explain observed variability in production in terms of the sensory acuity (auditory and somatosensory) of the speakers. We have also developed software for sensorimotor adaptation paradigms that allow us to perturb the speakers' auditory feedback in near real-time. These paradigms help elucidate how the system regulates speech production based on instantaneous feedback.


Functional neuroanatomy
=======================

The overall aim of this research area is to relate macro-anatomical brain characteristics (e.g., sulcal and gyral patterns, diffusion-inferred connectivity, cortical thickness) to functional differences (behavior and brain activity). There are several collaborative projects that address this aim. 

#. As part of a project funded by the Ellison Medical Foundation, we are investigating anatomical and behavioral differences between children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders, dyslexia and control populations.

#. As parts of two projects funded by NIMH, we are interested in interested in defining brain regions based on macroanatomy and characterizing shapes of these brains.
